      <h2>This is my about page</h2>
      <p>I'm a born again tech enthusiast with a passion for learning and growing in the field of technology.
        I'm someone who genuinely loves tech not just the gadgets and tools, but how technology can solve real problems
        and improve lives.
        I enjoy building systems that work, fixing things that don’t, and helping others along the way.At the core of
        everything I do is a bigger dream:
        to grow in the tech world so I can teach others, create meaningful solutions, and help make Kenya more
        tech-savvy. But beyond that, I’m passionate about
        merging tech with my faith in Christ to build systems and platforms that not only work but also uplift, inspire,
        and reflect God’s purpose.For me, it’s all
        about learning, building, and using tech to make a difference both practically and spiritually.</p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently pursuing a certificate in Web Development at <strong>Power Learn Project School</strong>, where
        I’m building skills in creating real world tech solutions.
        Before that, I had the opportunity to study at <strong>Yada School of Tech</strong>, where my passion for
        technology really began.
        These experiences have laid a solid foundation for my journey in tech and continue to shape the kind of
        solutions I aim to build.

      <h2>My Interests</h2>
      <p>
        What excites me most about technology is its ability to solve real-world problems and make life easier for
        individuals and communities.
        I’m especially passionate about using tech to build solutions that are practical, scalable, and
        accessible—particularly in areas that are still growing digitally, like many parts of Kenya.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love exploring how systems work behind the scenes, from web development to automation and system integration.
        My professional interests include software development,
        system design, and eventually teaching others how to use tech for impact. I’m also deeply passionate about
        merging technology with my faith in Christ to create solutions that are both technically sound and spiritually
        uplifting.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the long term, I hope to empower others through tech education, create systems that serve communities, and
        help Kenya—and beyond—become more tech-savvy, one solution at a time.
